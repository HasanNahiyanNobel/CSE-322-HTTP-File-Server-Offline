		Sometimes when my eyes are red<br>
		I go up on top of the RCA Building<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and gaze at my world, Manhattan&mdash;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my buildings, streets I&rsquo;ve done feats in,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lofts, beds, coldwater flats<br>
		&mdash;on Fifth Ave below which I also bear in mind,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its ant cars, little yellow taxis, men<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;walking the size of specks of wool&mdash;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;Panorama of the bridges, sunrise over Brooklyn machine,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sun go down over New Jersey where I was born<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; Paterson where I played with ants&mdash;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;my later loves on 15th Street,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my greater loves of Lower East Side,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my once fabulous amours in the Bronx &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; faraway&mdash;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;paths crossing in these hidden streets,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my history summed up, my absences &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and ecstasies in Harlem&mdash;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash;sun shining down on all I own<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in one eyeblink to the horizon<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in my last eternity&mdash;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;matter is water.<br>
		<br>


		Sad,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I take the elevator and go<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;down, pondering,<br>
		and walk on the pavements staring into all man&rsquo;s<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;plateglass, faces,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;questioning after who loves,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and stop, bemused<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in front of an automobile shopwindow<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; standing lost in calm thought,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;traffic moving up &amp; down 5th Avenue blocks behind me &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; waiting for a moment when...<br>
		<br>


		Time to go home &amp; cook supper &amp; listen to<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the romantic war news on the radio &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...all movement stops<br>
		&amp; I walk in the timeless sadness of existence, &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tenderness flowing thru the buildings,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my fingertips touching reality&rsquo;s face,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my own face streaked with tears in the mirror &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of some window&mdash;at dusk&mdash;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;where I have no desire&mdash;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for bonbons&mdash;or to own the dresses or Japanese &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lampshades of intellection&mdash;<br>
		<br>


		Confused by the spectacle around me,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Man struggling up the street<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;with packages, newspapers,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ties, beautiful suits &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;toward his desire<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Man, woman, streaming over the pavements &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;red lights clocking hurried watches &amp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; movements at the curb&mdash;<br>
		<br>


		And all these streets leading<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so crosswise, honking, lengthily,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by avenues<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stalked by high buildings or crusted into slums<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thru such halting traffic<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;screaming cars and engines &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		so painfully to this<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; countryside, this graveyard<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;this stillness<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on deathbed or mountain &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once seen<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; never regained or desired<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in the mind to come<br>
		where all Manhattan that I&rsquo;ve seen must disappear.<br>
